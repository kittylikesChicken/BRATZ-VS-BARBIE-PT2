      <h1 class="formynitey">Really,
        <h1>A tragic early victim of hustle culture if you think about it.</h1>
        <p>Bratz just felt more mature and fun and cool. They had big heads and pouty lips with long eyelashes and wore their hair in bubble ponytails with silver clips or straightened with zigzag headbands. And the ’fits? Fire. They took inspo from Black culture of the late 1990s and early 2000s and styled themselves in crop tops, cargo pants, miniskirts, jelly slides, and Steve Madden–esque wedges. It was bad bitch shit that even as a 6-year-old I knew I wanted to embody someday. Am I taking a couple of dolls with itty-bitty waists too seriously? Maybe. Were they a bit oversexualized for children’s toys? Pooooossibly. But to me, they were the epitome of badassery.</p>
        <h1> ICONS, but never BYGONES</h1>
        <h3 class="dido">Barbie,</h3>
        <p> meanwhile, was designed in the 1950s as a kind of palatable bimbo. She is an OG girl-boss who started out as a teenage fashion model but later became an astronaut, a surgeon, a NASCAR driver, and even the president. Really, a tragic early victim of hustle culture if you think about it. Her success was also her undoing: Over the decades, Barbie’s girl-next-door aesthetic was so emulated that it became passé. Queen of the basic bitches.</p> <img src=https://res.cloudinary.com/dbsmigkij/image/upload/v1695713762/Barbie-Movie-Deluxe-Beach-Doll_encci2.jpg>

        The Bratz would never. They served too much c*nt to give plain Jane. And I’m not talking strictly about fashion either. Friendship was core to the dolls’ identities. Their 2005 animated TV show and at least 10 direct-to-video movies gave us insight into their vibes and personalities. There was delusional and boy-crazy Cloe, understated and kind Yasmin, ambitious aspiring fashion editor Jade, and give-no-fucks Sasha, all of whom set the standard for ride-or-die besties.</h><img src=https://res.cloudinary.com/dbsmigkij/image/upload/v1695713115/Zc4CP3qQCUoFxQTvTK5EMhhdYgNFcC6DjLe0MMv8kNv1reYP6FLKv6wGDPQPwvUHSOC61MYfeA9ccwedgnf1ZK0vpUz1XI7q5eiDFG4VrAdoSV1LbGVu7_NJBK4PmmAmHOkWy1RGz4AWiVWXbC2icemh62vrpVcGFu00wbmfzQRdW_hqElbqOVWpFqT_RyLGjQpjR5KR0T2PBdoUdxjbTmzMxU09ec7_wc8udm.jpg>

        <h2 class="bratzy"> Despite the internet’s Barbie fixation, I know I’m not the last standing Bratz fan. </h2>

        <p> Just look at Bratz’s TikTok, where the brand has the dolls re-create Lady Gaga’s famous no-sleep monologue and Cassie’s “I have never ever been happier” scene from Euphoria for their 2.3 million followers. Bratz built its platform on inclusivity long ago, so it’s no wonder that the dolls now use their social followings to talk about injustices against Iranian women and boost queer representation, as when Roxxi (a 2004 doll) and Nevra (a 2003 doll) made their debut as a couple in 2020.</p>

        But it’s Barbie that’s getting all the attention and a full-length, big-budget, prestige feature film? Fine, I guess. Don’t get me wrong—I do have some affection for my sis Barb who effortlessly struts in unbearably high heels, refuses to settle down with a mediocre white boy, and switches jobs like I switch my men.

        To be clear, I will be seeing Barbie this weekend. I’m only human!

        So I’ll begrudgingly admit that Barbie has won this round. Barbie: 1. Bratz: 0. But that basic B better watch her back because my bigheaded girlies are coming for her neck. I’m already writing a four-page letter to MGA Entertainment and starting my Bratz film fundraiser on Reddit. Call me delusional or unhinged—I don’t care—the Bratz will return, and when they do, count your days, Barbara.</p>
        <p class="weewoo">
          Although I am not surprised that this war is still currently occurring since the release of the Barbie movie and another potential release of the BRATZ movie coming soon, it is still amazing to see how much these two brands of fashion dolls impacted a whole generation of girls to dress like them, and to gain confidence in being a girly girl. Not many toys have the power to embrace femininity and to make girls & women feel a heavy emotion towards a doll anymore. But even with phones and social media ruling the world, these two dolls still have an impactful way to rule the world of social media, and femininity as a whole. It has definitely impacted my life for the better, with Bratz having a black doll that actually had a good fashion sense and looked really pretty and not ordinary. Sasha looks just as pretty as Jade or Jasmine, and the diversity that Bratz had and still has since the beginning, was something that Barbie lacked.

          Now with that said…</p>
